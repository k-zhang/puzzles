/*
 * Brieâ€™s Drawing teacher asks her class to open their books to a page number.
 * Brie can either start turning pages from the front of the book or from the back of the book.
 * She always turns pages one at a time. When she opens the book, page  is always on the right side:
 *
 *      -----------------
 *      |       |       |
 *      |       |       |
 *      |       |   1   |
 *      |       |       |
 *      |       |       |
 *      -----------------
 *
 * When she flips page 1, she sees pages 2 and 3. Each page except the last page will always be printed on both sides.
 * The last page may only be printed on the front, given the length of the book.
 * If the book is n pages long, and she wants to turn to page , what is the minimum number of pages she will turn? She can start at the beginning or the end of the book.
 * Given n and p, find and print the minimum number of pages Brie must turn in order to arrive at page p.
 *
 * Function Description
 * Complete the pageCount function in the editor below. It should return the minimum number of pages Brie must turn.
 * pageCount has the following parameter(s):
 *      n: the number of pages in the book
 *      p: the page number to turn to
 *
 * Input Format
 * The first line contains an integer n, the number of pages in the book.
 * The second line contains an integer p, the page that Brie's teacher wants her to turn to.
